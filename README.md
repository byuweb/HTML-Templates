### Getting Started:
1. Replace Title with your own 
2. Fill in Meta tags - These have to be done for each page created! Dont get lazy. SEO depends on you.
3. Search - If you want to use the BYU Google GSA 
4. Breadcrumbs - Should be two levels
5. Content - Make this easy to read. Reading on the internet is different as users tend to scan pages rather than read
6. Footer - Use for Contact info, Social Media, or remove if unnecessary
7. Copyright Info - Please state who or what organization manages the site and provide a contact link.
